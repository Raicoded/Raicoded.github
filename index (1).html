I've been wanting to tell you how I feel for what feels like forever, and I'm hoping that somehow, someway, you might feel the same way.</p> <p>From the moment I met you, I was drawn to your sparkling eyes, your bright smile, and your infectious energy. But it's not just your outer beauty that captivates me - it's the kindness, empathy, and compassion that shines through in everything you do. You light up the room with your presence, and I feel so lucky to be around you.</p> <p>As I've gotten to know you better, I've fallen more and more in love with the way you make me feel. You're the sunshine that brightens up my day, the calm in every storm, and the safe haven where I can always be myself. Your laughter is music to my ears, and your smile is the brightest thing I've ever seen.</p> <p>I love the way we can talk for hours about nothing and everything, the way we can be silly and goofy together, and the way we can support each other through thick and thin. I love the way you challenge me to be my best self, the way you encourage me to take risks, and the way you believe in me even when I don't believe in myself.</p> <p>Most of all, I love the way you make me feel when we're together - like I'm home, like I'm exactly where I'm meant to be. You're the missing piece to my puzzle, the beat in my heart, and the air that I breathe.</p> <p>So here it is, Rai - I have feelings for you. Real, true, and deep feelings that I can't ignore anymore. I know this might be scary, and I know it might not be reciprocated, but I had to take the chance. I had to tell you how I feel, no matter how vulnerable it makes me.</p> <p>If you feel the same way, I promise to love you with all my heart, to support you through every up and down, and to cherish you for who you are. And if you don't feel the same way, I promise to still be your friend, to still care for you deeply, and to still be grateful for the time we've shared together.</p> <p>Either way, I had to take the leap and confess my feelings to you. I hope you'll consider my words, and I hope that maybe, just maybe, we can explore this feeling together.</p> <p>Yours always,</p> <p>[]</p> </div> </body> </html>
